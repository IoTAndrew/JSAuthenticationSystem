# JSAuthenticationSystem
This program is a simple JavaScript account system that I have taken from multiple YouTube videos. 
I will be modifying it to work with a database and a RESTful API for my university project.

UPD: I have successfully embedded SQLite3 database into the login system and made a RESTful API.
